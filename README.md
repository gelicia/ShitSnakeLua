ShitSnakeLua
============

Creating a shit snake clone in Lua using the LÃ¶ve engine as a learning exercise. 

The original shit snake was created by Draknek and can be played here http://www.draknek.org/games/shitsnake/

Thanks to [Draknek](https://github.com/Draknek) for the lulz and [slembcke](https://github.com/slembcke) for the patient guidance through my first game.
