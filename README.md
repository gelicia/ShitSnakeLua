ShitSnakeLua
============

Creating a shit snake clone in Lua using the Löve engine as a learning exercise. 

Including the packaged Löve file for convenience, but please remember to remove it if you take the two lua files and want to package it yourself.

The original shit snake was created by Draknek and can be played at http://www.draknek.org/games/shitsnake/

Thanks to [Draknek](https://github.com/Draknek) for the lulz and [slembcke](https://github.com/slembcke) for the patient guidance through my first game.
